Title: Functional Regression using Signal Compression Approach
Version: 0.3.0
Author: Ruiyan Luo, Xin Qi
Maintainer: Ruiyan Luo <rluo@gsu.edu>
Description: Signal compression methods for functional regression. It includes various function-on-function (FOF) regression models such as the linear FOF model with functional response and both scalar and functional predictors for a small number of functional predictors, linear FOF models with a large number of functional predictors, linear FOF model for spiky data, stepwise selection for FOF models with two-way interactions, and nonlinear FOF models. It also includes scalar-on-function regression models with single (SOF) or multivariate (mSOF) scalar response variable, and SOF model for spiky data.
