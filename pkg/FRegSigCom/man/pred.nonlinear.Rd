 \item{X.test}{new observations of functional predictors. It is a list of length \eqn{p}, the number of functional predcitors. Each element is the observed  matrix from a functional predictor, with rows repsenting observation vectors and columns corresponding to the observation time points.

}
\item{t.y.test}{a vector of observation time points where values of predicted response curves are to be calculated. If \code{t.y.test}=NULL (default), \code{t.y} in \code{\link{cv.nonlinear}} will be used.}

\value{A matrix which contains the predicted values of response
  curves. The number of rows equal to  the sample size of the new data
  set, and the number of columns is equal to the length of
  \code{t.y.test} or \code{t.y} when \code{t.y.test}=NULL.
