\arguments{
  \item{fit.cv}{the CV object obtained by \code{\link{cv.hd}}.}
%%     ~~Describe \code{fit.cv} here~~
 \item{X.test}{new observations of functional predictors. It is a list of length \eqn{p}, the number of functional predcitors. Each element is the observed  matrix from a functional predictor, with rows repsenting observation vectors and columns corresponding to the observation time points.
%%     ~~Describe \code{X.test} here~~
}
\item{t.y.test}{a vector of observation time points where values of predicted response curves are to be calculated. If \code{t.y.test}=NULL (default), \code{t.y} in \code{\link{cv.hd}} will be used.}
}
\value{A matrix containing the predicted values of response curves for
  the new observations. The number of rows  equals to the sample size of
  the new data set, and the number of columns equals to the length of
  \code{t.y.test} or \code{t.y} when \code{t.y.test}=NULL.
